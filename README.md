Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis using SQL
This project involves calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to estimate the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over their entire relationship. Using SQL, I aggregated transaction data to compute total revenue, purchase frequency, average purchase value, and CLV. Customers were then segmented into high, medium, and low-value groups. The analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer retention.
